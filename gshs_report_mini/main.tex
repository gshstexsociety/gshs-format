%\section{Introduction}

A country's anthem is a very important song. Lets learn about them.

\section{United States of America}
O say, can you see

By the dawn's early light

What so proudly we hailed

At the twilight's last gleaming?

Whose broad stripes and bright stars

Through the perilous fight

O'er the ramparts we watched,

Were so gallantly, yeah, streaming?

And the rockets' red glare

The bombs bursting in air

Gave proof through the night

That our flag was still there

O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave

O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave


\section{Union of the Soviet Socialist Republic}
Союз нерушимый республик свободных

Сплотила навеки Великая Русь.

Да здравствует созданный волей народов

Единый, могучий Советский Союз!

Славься, Отечество наше свободное,

Дружбы, народов надежный оплот!

Знамя советское, знамя народное

Пусть от победы, к победе ведет!

\begin{remark}
    Remember, no Russian.
\end{remark}

\section{The Great Britain}
I vow to thee, my country, all earthly things above

Entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love

The love that asks no question, the love that stands the test

That lays upon the altar, the dearest and the best

The love that never falters, the love that pays the price

The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice

\begin{remark}
    Actually it's not the official anthem.
\end{remark}

\section*{In conclusion}
This section has no number!!
